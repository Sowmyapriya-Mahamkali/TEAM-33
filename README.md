## Problem Statement

Effective communication in multilingual environments—such as healthcare, education, and global workplaces—remains a challenge. Existing translation tools are often delayed, screen-dependent, or lack contextual understanding, resulting in miscommunication, inefficiency, and cognitive overload.

There is a critical need for an **intelligent, real-time system** capable of understanding spoken language, maintaining context, and generating accurate multilingual responses seamlessly.


## Proposed Solution

We present a **GenAI-powered real-time multilingual AI agent** designed to facilitate seamless bidirectional communication between users speaking different languages.

The system leverages **foundation models for speech recognition and language generation**, enhanced with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for context-aware accuracy.

**Workflow Overview:**

1. **Listen** — AI captures live speech and converts it to text using advanced speech recognition models (Whisper).  
2. **Understand & Retrieve** — The AI Agent identifies speaker language, maintains conversation context, and retrieves relevant knowledge for accurate responses.  
3. **Generate & Respond** — The AI generates precise multilingual translations in real time, enabling natural conversation flow.  

> *Note: While the future vision includes integration with smart earbuds for hands-free delivery, the current prototype focuses entirely on the AI-driven real-time translation system.*>

## Key Highlights

- **Autonomous AI Agent:** Performs real-time decision-making for language detection, context maintenance, and response generation.  
- **Generative AI (GenAI) Integration:** Produces natural, context-aware multilingual responses.  
- **RAG-Enhanced Accuracy:** Ensures translations respect domain-specific vocabulary and conversational history.  
- **Scalable & Extensible:** Designed for integration with future hardware interfaces, such as smart earbuds.

## Architecture Overview

The system is designed as a modular, agent-oriented pipeline that processes multilingual conversations end-to-end in real time. Each component is responsible for a well-defined function and can be independently scaled or replaced.

**End-to-end pipeline:**

Speech Input → ASR → Context & RAG → LLM Reasoning → TTS → Speech Output

The AI Agent Controller coordinates all modules, manages conversation state, and ensures low-latency execution.

## Core Components

### Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
- Converts live or recorded speech into text
- Automatically detects the source language
- Built using Whisper for robustness to accents and noise

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Retrieves domain-specific and conversational context
- Grounds LLM responses to reduce hallucinations
- Supports local knowledge base with vector-database extensibility

### Generative AI (LLM Layer)
- Generates context-aware multilingual responses
- Maintains conversational history
- Supports configurable foundation models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Converts generated responses into natural speech
- Supports multiple languages and neural voices
- Designed for real-time voice delivery

### Agent Controller
- Orchestrates ASR, RAG, LLM, and TTS modules
- Manages session context and error handling
- Provides a unified interface for file-based and live audio processing
