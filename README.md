# TEAM-33 — GenAI-Powered Real-Time Multilingual AI Agent

## Problem Statement

Effective communication in multilingual environments—such as healthcare, education, and global workplaces—remains a challenge. Existing translation tools are often delayed, screen-dependent, or lack contextual understanding, resulting in miscommunication, inefficiency, and cognitive overload.

There is a critical need for an **intelligent, real-time system** capable of understanding spoken language, maintaining context, and generating accurate multilingual responses seamlessly.


## Proposed Solution

We present a **GenAI-powered real-time multilingual AI agent** designed to facilitate seamless bidirectional communication between users speaking different languages.

The system leverages **foundation models for speech recognition and language generation**, enhanced with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for context-aware accuracy.

**Workflow Overview:**

1. **Listen** — AI captures live speech and converts it to text using advanced speech recognition models (Whisper).  
2. **Understand & Retrieve** — The AI Agent identifies speaker language, maintains conversation context, and retrieves relevant knowledge for accurate responses.  
3. **Generate & Respond** — The AI generates precise multilingual translations in real time, enabling natural conversation flow.  

> *Note: While the future vision includes integration with smart earbuds for hands-free delivery, the current prototype focuses entirely on the AI-driven real-time translation system.*


## Key Highlights

- **Autonomous AI Agent:** Performs real-time decision-making for language detection, context maintenance, and response generation.  
- **Generative AI (GenAI) Integration:** Produces natural, context-aware multilingual responses.  
- **RAG-Enhanced Accuracy:** Ensures translations respect domain-specific vocabulary and conversational history.  
- **Scalable & Extensible:** Designed for integration with future hardware interfaces, such as smart earbuds.
